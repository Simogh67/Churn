# Predict Customer Churn

## Project Description
In this repository, we implement a machine learning-based algorithm to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. 
The main scope of this repository is to present some software development practices for machine learning such as testing, logging, and best coding practices. 

The repository includes Python scripts for the project that follows coding (PEP8) and software engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The project can be run from the command-line interface (CLI).


## Running Files
To run the scripts:

**python churn_library.py**

**python test_churn.py**

running the scripts generates the following items:

- EDA plots in the directory ./images/EDA/
- The Machine learning models metrics plots in the directory ./images/metrics/
- The best model pickle files in the directory ./models/
- logs stored in log file ./log/churn_library.log
